    This demo uses lossless compression (OxiPNG) to reduce the image size. The
    image was compressed using a maximum effort of 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>To demonstrate lossless compression we are using an image which features
      many sharp edges. Lossless compression does not perform well on
      photographs which tend to have a high frequency, gradients and many
      colors.</i>
