    This demo includes an uncompressed image with an intrinsic width of 640px.
    On a device with a viewport larger than 540px, the image is displayed at a
    maximum of 640px. On devices with a smaller viewport, it is displayed at
    <code>calc(100vw - 2rem)</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each demo also includes a script which is used to update the table beneath
    the image. The
    <i>Percentage Used</i>
    is calculated as the
    <code>(Display Width * Display Height) * DPR^2 / Intrinsic Width * Intrinsic
      Height</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the script to work it downloads the image again, so if you have
    <i>Disable cache</i>
    selected then you would see duplicate requests in the Network tab on
    DevTools.

    If you look at the table above, you could see that the image size is 445 KB
    and it's resolution is 640px x 426px. The area it is displayed in, marked as
    Display Width and Display Height is dependent on your device's viewport. The
    DPR shows your the device-pixel ratio of your device.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the
    <i>Percentage Used</i>
    is greater than 100%, then the image is smaller than the area in which it is
    rendered. If the
    <i>Percentage Used</i>
    is less than 100%, then it is bigger than the area in which it is rendered..
